EC463 Senior Design 

  ClearSol is a self-contained solar energy system in which a self-cleaning Electrodynamic Screen (EDS) is applied over the solar panel. When dust accumulates on the panel, the film can be charged for a few minutes, clearing the dust off the panel. Clearsol also implements a supercapacitor energy storage system, allowing for better performance under a wide temperature range. We aim for our design to be fully self-contained, capable of operating in an extreme range of temperatures, and able to power the EDS by itself as well as able to output a steady supply of electricity to a load.

  In the following manual, we intend to further explain the principles of how the system operates, its capabilities, as well as how it would see more real world applications, whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial.
